# Brain Tumor and Hemorrhage Detection using Image Processing and Machine Learning

This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate diagnostic tool for brain tumor and hemorrhage detection using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

Brain tumors and hemorrhages pose significant threats to human life. This project addresses this challenge by integrating image processing and machine learning to analyze medical images for precise abnormality identification.

**Key Features:**

* **Image Enhancement:** Utilizes MATLAB to apply sophisticated filters for noise and artifact reduction in medical images.
* **Region-Based Segmentation:** Employs segmentation techniques to isolate regions of interest, simulating a virtual dissection for detailed analysis.
* **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features for quantitative analysis using machine learning algorithms.
* **Diagnostic Approach:** Provides an efficient and accurate diagnostic approach for brain tumor and hemorrhage detection.
* **Collaboration:** Emphasizes collaboration with medical professionals for result validation and ethical considerations.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main phases:

1.  **Image Processing (MATLAB):**
    * Image preprocessing (noise reduction, artifact removal).
    * Region-based segmentation for abnormality isolation.
2.  **Machine Learning:**
    * Feature extraction from segmented regions.
    * Model training and evaluation for tumor and hemorrhage detection.

## Technologies Used

* **MATLAB:** For image processing and initial algorithm development.
* **Machine Learning:** Various machine learning algorithms for classification and detection.
* (Future) **Python:** For future replication and expansion, leveraging libraries like OpenCV, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
